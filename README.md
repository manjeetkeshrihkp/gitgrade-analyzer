# 🚀 GitGrade Analyzer

**GitGrade Analyzer** is an AI-powered GitHub repository analysis tool that evaluates a public repository and converts it into a **Score**, **Smart Summary**, and a **Personalized Improvement Roadmap** — similar to feedback from a senior developer or recruiter.

## 🎯 Purpose

In today’s tech-driven hiring ecosystem, a GitHub repository represents a developer’s real skill. However, many students and early developers are unsure:
- How clean and readable their code is
- Whether their project structure looks professional
- If their commits and documentation meet industry standards

**GitGrade Analyzer acts as a “Repository Mirror”**, reflecting the true strengths and weaknesses of a GitHub project.

## 🧠 What GitGrade Analyzer Does

### 1️⃣ Accepts GitHub Repository URL
Users paste a **public GitHub repository link** to start the analysis.

### 2️⃣ Automatically Analyzes Repository Data
The system evaluates publicly available signals such as:
- Folder and file structure
- Code quality & readability
- README and documentation quality
- Test presence and maintainability
- Commit history & consistency
- Language and tech stack usage
- Git best practices
- Real-world project relevance

### 3️⃣ AI-Powered Evaluation
Repositories are analyzed across:
- Code clarity & organization
- Project structure
- Documentation depth
- Maintainability
- Development consistency
- Practical usefulness

### 4️⃣ Intelligent Outputs

#### ✅ Score / Rating
- Numeric score (0–100)
- Skill level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

#### 📝 Summary
A concise, recruiter-style evaluation of the repository.

**Example:**
> “The project has clean structure and consistent commits, but lacks tests and detailed documentation.”

#### 🛣️ Personalized Roadmap
Actionable improvement steps such as:
- Improve folder structure
- Add or enhance README
- Write unit/integration tests
- Follow meaningful commit practices
- Improve code readability
- Introduce CI/CD workflows
